/// keeps revealing columns, because reaching the edge extends the grid before
/// the next scroll would have stopped at it.

/// it writes no journal entry and never reaches the snapshot, so the grid a
/// file declares on save is still the used range — the same split the engine
/// already makes for a <dimension> that runs to the last column (workbook.rs
/// declared_extent) — and it is dispatched as a mutation, so it pushes no undo
/// entry either. Scrolling is a view action: a pristine blank sheet that grew
/// past column F on a scroll must leave the Undo button disabled, or the first
/// Ctrl+Z after typing at AA1 shrinks the grid back instead of undoing the
/// edit.

 * command is dispatched on every scroll — wheel, scrollbar, keyboard — and
 * carries sheetViewStartColumn/Row directly, so no pixel-to-index conversion
 * is needed.
 *
 * Two triggers, because neither alone covers everything:
 *   - the command subscription, which is the real signal
 *   - a slow poll, for a scroll the command path does not cover, and because
 *     the render unit only exists a moment after install
 *
 * The poll reads the viewport from the skeleton rather than the command stream,
 * so it can answer before any scroll command has arrived. Its early bail reads
 * the command stream's lastColumn to skip the width walk, which narrows the
 * poll: a scroll the command path genuinely misses now goes ungrown until a
 * later command moves lastColumn. The command fires on wheel, scrollbar and
 * keyboard alike, so that miss is rare.
 *
 * Returns a disposer.
